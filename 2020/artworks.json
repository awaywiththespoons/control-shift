Normative tools of communication are changing, our screens are liquifying the borders between the office, our homes, & protests.<br><br> Developing from Arjun & Ben’s pre-existing work on access tools for protest in collaboration with activist group Disabled People Against Cuts, we ask three creative practitioners: how have ways of seeing & being seen reshaped the nuances of accessibility under lockdown? <br><br>With this question, we have produced three film vignettes, each with a different performance-based practitioner, to think about how digital protest tools might be used beyond service, as methods and medium for art making. In doing so, the collaborations reflect on the aesthetics of access, and the styles and perspectives produced through what is or isn’t accessible to the particular needs of each artist. Produced remotely, the work uses custom wearable rigs, video conference calling, chat functions, and audio calls both in process and in final outcome. <br><br>Using each of their own practices and subjective relationship with accessibility, these vignettes subvert communications tools to explore representation, inclusion, intimacy and allyship. We are proud to be working with Sky Cubacub, Ebony Dark Rose, and a third artist who will be announced shortly. <br><br>These films will contain audio description, BSL & captioning."],

It is on this basis that we use the theme indigeneity and digital entanglements to invoke a new system of thought. One that alludes to a more productive and equitable arrangement of technology, its tools and structures. A reimagined system that accounts for humanity’s multi-dimensionality and proposes a new digital political economy. This proposition rethinks technology, without hardware or software and beyond advanced algorithms.<br><br>This programme of short films offers counter evidence to the popular belief that technology is a construction of the West. This considered selection of films can be understood as a sample of cinematic expressions from Africa addressing the politics of technology and its consequences for the continent. They affirm Africa as an active agent in the production of technology through indigenous practices.<br><br>The films were presented in the Arnolfini Art Centre in central Bristol.<br><br>Films:<br><br><strong>Deep Down Tidal, Tabita Rezaire, South Africa, 2017, 18.44 min.</strong><br>It may feel as if the internet is up in the clouds, but in actual fact it's at the bottom of the ocean, in the form of 880,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cables. These cables make up the essential infrastructure for sending all our emails, websites, photos, films and of course emoticons. Beneath the waves, our wireless life is very bound up with physical wires—it's the virtual made physical. Among the submerged cities, drowned sailors and hidden histories, the ocean is home to a complex communications network. Here, the technologies controlled by the West expand along the old colonial routes, so in a way the cables are the hardware of a new, electronic imperialism. Deep Down Tidal is a video essay in typical net.art style, weaving together cosmological, spiritual, political and technological narratives about water and its role in communication, then and now. It's about how this cable network can facilitate the retention and expansion of power. It also reminds us that water doesn’t forget.<br><br><strong>Ifu Elimnyama: The Dark Cloud, Russel Hlongwane, South Africa, 2019, 6.34min.</strong><br>Set in the year 1220 of the recently decimated metropolis village of The Great Mapungubwe, uMalanje, the installer flaneur moving curiously across time-space. uMalanje, broke away from a group of remaining villagers after the near obliteration the metropolis kingdom of Mapungubwe. The surviving few decided to send a group of their kind to the fourth dimension in order to preserve the black race. Upon this decision, a consensus was reached that the history of the black race (since the Big Bang) would be secretly stored in the cloud. The local wealthy and resourceful Nqomqhayise family was given custodianship of this cloud. <br><br>However, the grandson of the Nqomqhayise family is secretly flying to Silicon Valley to lure venture capitalists to invest in his shrewd digital empire. His plan is to migrate the history of the black civilisation into his company's server after which he will infect the cloud and charge the population to access their own history. <br><br>Upon this threat, the imincwi (those who migrated to the fourth dimension) secretly return to devise a strategy to counter Nqomqhayise’s shrewd plan. They have assembled a group of elite technologists from Mapungubwe to travel to Nairobi where they will work with local technologist to revive the cloud and hopefully successfully foil Nqomqhayise’s plan.

The diviner discovers that the wife is cheating on him, and offers him evil medicine (kifaro) to deal with the problem. The film is an exploration of science and African divination systems under the framework of technology.<br><br><strong>Core Dump, Shenzen, Fracois Knoetze, South Africa, 2019, 12.17min.</strong><br>Core Dump is a series of 4 films, Kinshasa (2018), Shenzhen (2019), New York (2019) and Dakar (2018). The project explores the relationship between digital technology, cybernetics, colonialism and the reenchanted notion of a Non-Aligned Humanist Utopia.<br><br>The four films of Core Dump are rhizomatic assemblages of found footage, performance documentation and recorded interviews that form narrative portraits of the uncertainty in the nervous system of the digital earth. The films are fragmented arrangements of images and sounds, with each chapter forming links across geographic and temporal discontinuities. The conceptual framework draws from audiovisual archives, and responds to the pan-African, Marxist utopias of early African cinema (specifically Ousmane Sembene’s films), and a range of writers and thinkers – from Donna Haraway, Sylvia Wynter and Louis Chude-Sokei to Gayatri Spivak, Franz Fanon, and Aimé Césaire.<br><br>The series compares critical contexts and histories to suggest that the crucial technologies involved in moving towards a more just and equitable world are less physical than they are social. While the cynical billionaires of Silicon Valley invest in transhumanist technologies in an attempt to become immortal, build luxury underground apocalypse bunkers to fight off future climate refugees, and design rockets to colonise mars, Core Dump emerges from the dystopian landfills of consumer culture as an imaginary of a new inclusive humanism that underscores relationality and interhuman narratives."],
