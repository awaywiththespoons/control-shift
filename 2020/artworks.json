In doing so, the collaborations reflect on the aesthetics of access, and the styles and perspectives produced through what is or isn’t accessible to the particular needs of each artist. Produced remotely, the work uses custom wearable rigs, video conference calling, chat functions, and audio calls both in process and in final outcome. <br><br>Using each of their own practices and subjective relationship with accessibility, these vignettes subvert communications tools to explore representation, inclusion, intimacy and allyship.

There are many interventions that keep Bristol’s relationship with water flowing and smooth. Watery compositions created from underwater sounds and shaped by tidal data, are integrated into the walk, inviting us to consider the potential future of rising sea levels.

Their interests run the full range of physical to digital and and they like to crossover and bring this together in unlikely combinations as often as possible: robotics, music, sketching, programming, sound-art, making, painting, crafting, patchworking and print-making. They make silly, simple and rewarding things with high and low tech."],

We have listened to new birdsong, and to the silence of carless streets - things we lost as the world unlocked. We invite you to join us in making contact with those things that have departed, in both physical and virtual, human and non-human. We hope to inspire new ways of being in the world; finding what we have lost that was valuable, and discarding the rest."],
